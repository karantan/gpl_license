# gpl_license
The GPL has some important extra requirements over BSD-3: If you distribute a modified form of a GPL-licensed program, or binaries compiled from it, then you must also make your modified version of the program available under the same license as the original.

The BSD licenses do not require this: You are free to take a BSD program, modify it, keep your additions private, and distribute/sell the binaries.
